I'm currently a master student in NISL, Tsinghua University. I got my undergraduate degree at Beijing Institute of Technology.

My research interests include fuzzing and vulnerability discovery. I'm also a programming language enthusiast.

I was an ICPC candidate and now I'm enjoying CTF.

You can reach me by [msr20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:msr20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).
